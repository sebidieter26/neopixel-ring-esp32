# neopixel-ring-esp32
Project created personally by me in a college course

**Highlights**
First things first, I have divided my objective into smaller tasks : 

- Researching about the hardware and the software I was going to use
- Getting the hardware parts and wiring them up on a bread board
- Creating a Web Server and connecting to the ESP32
- Creating the Web Application and uploaded on the Web Server 

**What did I use ?**

### HARDWARE

- Groundstudio Carbon D4(ESP32)
- NeoPixel LED Ring(12 LEDs)
- Capacitor(1000 mF 10V)
- Resistor(330 ohm)

### SOFTWARE

- Arduino IDE

**How to - Step by step**
